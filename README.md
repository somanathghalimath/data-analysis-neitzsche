# Data analysis of large texts.

The usage is pretty simple, import the notebook and provide the filename/path and the results should show up in form of different plots.
This file can be used for any large text, I have used it specifically for Nietschze.

Feel free to DM me on LinkedIn for any questions, feedback or comments.
